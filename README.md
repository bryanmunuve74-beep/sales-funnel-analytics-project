## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Sales Funnel Analytics Dashboard** is a web-based analytics tool designed to help businesses track, analyze, and improve their customer conversion funnel.

It identifies:

* Where customers drop off
* Why purchases fail
* Which marketing channels work
* How sales performance varies

The system simulates a real consulting solution for e-commerce and digital businesses.
